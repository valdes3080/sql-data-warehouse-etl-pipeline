# E-Commerce Data Warehouse Pipeline (EcomDW)
Overview

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a complete end-to-end data engineering pipeline for an e-commerce analytics platform. The system simulates a production-style workflow where raw transactional data is generated, ingested through an ETL pipeline, modeled in a dimensional warehouse, and exposed through business intelligence reports.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate practical experience with data pipeline architecture, dimensional modeling, ETL orchestration, data validation, and analytics reporting.

### 1️⃣ Warehouse Schema
The warehouse follows a star schema design optimized for analytical workloads.

### 2️⃣ SSIS Control Flow
The ETL pipeline is orchestrated using SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS).
![SSIS Control Flow](EcomDW_Project/Images/SSIS_Control_Flow.png)

# Key Pipline Stages Include:
Pipeline initialization

Staging loads

Dimension upserts

Fact table loading

Validation framework

Execution logging

---

### 3️⃣ Data Flow
CSV files are processed through an SSIS data flow which performs transformations before loading staging tables.

# Transformations performed:

Data type conversions

Error handling paths

Staging table insertion




  
### 4️⃣ Staging Layer
Raw source data is first loaded into the staging table:

stg.SalesRaw

The staging layer serves several purposes:

Preserve raw source data

Enable validation and cleansing

Support reprocessing if needed
---




### 5️⃣ Deduplication Logic
To enforce the correct grain of the dataset, a staging view removes duplicate records.

Grain Enforced:

SalesDate
ProdectId
StoreId

Implementation uses a window function:

ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
PARTITION BY SaleDate, ProductId, StoreId
ORDER BY LoadDttm DESC
)

Only the most recent record per grain is retained.
---


### 6️⃣ Dimension Upserts
Dimension tables are maintained using an upsert pattern:

Update existing dimension records if attributes change

Insert new dimension records when the natural key does not exist

This ensures the warehouse dimensions stay synchronized with the incoming source data.

---

### 7️⃣ Fact Table Loading
Fact records are loaded after dimension tables are updated.

The fact table grain is defined as:
DateKey
ProductKey
StoreKey

Surrogate keys are resolved by joining staging data to dimension tables.

Duplicate facts are prevented using NOT EXISTS checks.

### 8️⃣ Pipeline Observability
Each pipeline execution generates a unique RunId.

This identifier allows all ETL steps to be associated with a single execution.

Execution metadata is stored in:

etl.RunLog

Example tracked information:

Pipeline step name

Row counts

Execution status

Timestamps


### 9️⃣ Data Validation Framework

A validation stored procedure acts as a data quality gate before pipeline completion.

![Data Validation](EcomDW_Project/Images/ValidationQuery_2.png)

## Validation checks include:

row count comparisons across pipeline stages

duplicate fact grain detection

missing dimension key checks

domain rule validation

price anomaly detection

If critical validation rules fail, the pipeline stops execution.

### 🔟 SSRS Sales Overview Report
The warehouse powers an SSRS report that provides an overview of sales performance.
