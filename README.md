# E-Commerce Data Warehouse Pipeline (EcomDW)
Overview

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a complete end-to-end data engineering pipeline for an e-commerce analytics platform. The system simulates a production-style workflow where raw transactional data is generated, ingested through an ETL pipeline, modeled in a dimensional warehouse, and exposed through business intelligence reports.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate practical experience with data pipeline architecture, dimensional modeling, ETL orchestration, data validation, and analytics reporting.

### Project Architecture

The pipeline transforms generated transactional data into a structured analytics warehouse.
